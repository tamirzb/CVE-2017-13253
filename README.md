# CVE-2017-13253

PoC code for CVE-2017-13253 is here.

The full write-up is available [here](https://blog.zimperium.com/cve-2017-13253-buffer-overflow-multiple-android-drm-services). Note that the numbers are a little bit different from the blog post, as I've found that there's a higher chance for a crash with a heap of 0x2000 (of course if you run it enough times it should crash anyway).

## Build

In order to build this:

1. [Download the Android source code](https://source.android.com/setup/downloading).
2. Put this repository in `AOSP/external`.
3. Run the following given commands:

```
    cd AOSP
    source build/envsetup.sh
    make icrypto_overflow
```

## Result

Running this against an unpatched version of Android (8.0-8.1 before March 2018) should result in an overflow. This might result in a crash, depending on whether the overwritten data is writable or not.

The code should print the output of the `decrypt` method, which may vary:

* In case it is being ran against a patched version of Android (March 2018 or later) then `decrypt` should return `BAD_VALUE` (-22).
* In case no crash happens (the overwritten data is writable) then `decrypt` should return the amount of data it copied.
* In case the vendor implements the HAL as a seperate process (e.g.  Pixel 2) then `decrypt` should return `UNKNOWN_ERROR` (-32).
* In case the vendor implements the HAL in the same process (e.g.  Nexus 5X) then `decrypt` should return 0.

Below is the partial crash dump resulted from running this PoC:

```

As you can see, the fault address is the memory just after the shared memory. Since this memory is write-protected, the overflow resulted in a segmentation fault.
